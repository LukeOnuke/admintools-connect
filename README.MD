***AdminTools Connect*** is a plugin that allows connections with the ATC
protocol.

The ATC protocol is a peer to peer remote console over https. That means
it does not require any open ports to function.

It is obviously developed for [admintools.app](https://admintools.app).

For more technical info consult the 
[admintools documentation on ATC](https://docs.admintools.app/admin%20tools%20connect/what-is-it/).

## How do I use it?
1. Download and install the **Admin Tools Connect** plugin from either *modrtinth* or *spigot*.
2. Open [admintools.app](https://admintools.app) and go to add server.
3. Choose `ATC` and input the name you want for that server. Then press the `generate server id and copy` button.
4. Paste that command in your minecraft server.
5. You now should be able to connect to it by clicking on the server card.
