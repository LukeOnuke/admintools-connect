# This file controls security and command validation settings for remote command execution

security:
  # Enable or disable command validation (default: true)
  # Set to false to allow all commands without restrictions (NOT RECOMMENDED)
  command-validation: true
  
  # Whitelist mode (default: false)
  # false = Blacklist mode - allow all commands EXCEPT those in blocked-commands
  # true = Whitelist mode - allow ONLY commands in allowed-commands
  whitelist-mode: false
  
  # Global settings - applies to anyone with the global permission
  global:
    # Permission required for global command access
    permission: atc.commands.global
    
    # Commands allowed in whitelist mode (ignored in blacklist mode unless whitelist-mode is true)
    allowed-commands:
      - help
      - list
      - tps
      - version
    
    # Commands blocked (blacklist mode) - these are ALWAYS blocked unless overridden by groups/players
    # Recommended: Keep critical server commands blocked
    blocked-commands:
      - stop
      - restart
      - reload
      - op
      - deop
      - whitelist
      - ban-ip
      - pardon-ip
  
  # Group-based settings - higher priority than global
  # Users with group permissions can execute group-specific commands
  groups:
    # Admin group example
    admin:
      permission: atc.commands.admin
      allowed-commands:
        - kick
        - ban
        - pardon
        - gamemode
        - teleport
        - give
        - clear
        - difficulty
        - weather
        - time
      blocked-commands:
        - stop
        - restart
        - op
        - deop
    
    # Moderator group example
    moderator:
      permission: atc.commands.moderator
      allowed-commands:
        - kick
        - mute
        - warn
        - teleport
      blocked-commands:
        - ban
        - pardon
        - gamemode
        - give
        - op
        - deop
        - stop
        - restart
  
  # Player-specific settings - highest priority
  # These override both global and group settings
  players:
    # Example player configuration (remove or customize)
    # exampleplayer:
    #   permission: atc.commands.exampleplayer
    #   allowed-commands:
    #     - help
    #     - list
    #   blocked-commands:
    #     - kick
    #     - ban

# How the priority system works:
# 1. Player-specific settings (highest priority) - checked first
# 2. Group settings (medium priority) - checked if no player-specific match
# 3. Global settings (lowest priority) - fallback
#
# In whitelist-mode: Command must be in allowed-commands to execute
# In blacklist-mode: Command must NOT be in blocked-commands to execute
