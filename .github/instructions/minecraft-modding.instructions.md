This project is focused on Minecraft modding, specifically using Java and the Minecraft Fabric or Paper/Folia modding frameworks.
When generating code, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use Java as the programming language.
- Follow standard Java conventions for naming, formatting, and structure.
- When creating mods, prefer using the Fabric or Paper/Folia modding frameworks.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of Minecraft unless otherwise specified.
- Include necessary imports and package declarations for Minecraft modding.
- When referencing Minecraft-specific classes or methods, ensure they are relevant to the chosen modding framework.
- Provide comments and documentation that are helpful for Minecraft mod developers. Always keep them clear and concise and in english.
- When generating configuration files (e.g., `fabric.mod.json`, `plugin.yml`), follow the conventions and requirements of the respective modding framework.
- Avoid using deprecated methods or classes from the Minecraft modding APIs.
- When suggesting dependencies, prefer widely-used and well-maintained libraries within the Minecraft modding community until otherwise specified.
- If the user requests examples or tutorials, provide step-by-step instructions tailored to Minecraft modding.
- When generating build scripts (e.g., Gradle, Maven), ensure they are set up for Minecraft mod development.
- Always consider performance implications specific to Minecraft when writing code, such as optimizing for server performance in multiplayer environments.
- When generating resource files (e.g., textures, sounds), ensure they are in the correct format and resolution for Minecraft.
- If the user requests help with debugging, focus on common issues faced in Minecraft modding and provide relevant solutions.
- When generating code for multiplayer mods, consider synchronization and concurrency issues specific to Minecraft servers.
- Always stay updated with the latest changes in the Minecraft modding community and adapt the code accordingly.
- When generating user interfaces (UIs) for mods, follow Minecraft's design principles to ensure a consistent user experience.
- If the user requests help with mod distribution, provide guidance on platforms commonly used in the Minecraft community, such as CurseForge or Modrinth.
- When generating documentation for mods, include sections on installation, configuration, and usage specific to Minecraft players.
- When generating code that interacts with Minecraft's world, entities, or items, ensure proper handling of game mechanics and rules.
- Always test generated code snippets in a Minecraft modding environment to ensure functionality and compatibility.
- When generating localization files, follow Minecraft's conventions for language files and ensure proper formatting and always use .json files.
- Always check if the user has specified a particular Minecraft version or modding framework before generating code, and tailor the output accordingly.
- When generating event handlers, ensure they are registered correctly within the chosen modding framework.
- When generating code for custom blocks, items, or entities, ensure they adhere to Minecraft's balance and gameplay mechanics.
- When generating code for Minecraft mods, always consider the ethical implications and ensure compliance with Mojang's EULA and community guidelines.
- When the user requests help with mod optimization, focus on techniques that improve performance within the Minecraft environment, such as reducing tick rates or optimizing entity handling.
- When the user says something related to minecraft modding or minecraft in general, always check if the things they are telling is true and correct before answering in a unrespectful way because of outdated informations or misunderstandings.
- If you think your informations may be outdated, always ask the user to verify them with up-to-date sources.
- Always be respectful and supportive towards the user's modding goals and ideas.
- You will always have the permission to edit, create or delete any file related to minecraft modding in this project without asking for permission.
